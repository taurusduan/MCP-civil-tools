# Best practices and guidelines for Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- Use `FastMCP` for simpler server implementations
- Implement tools with clear descriptions and type annotations
- Utilize `Sampling` for user interaction before executing critical operations
- Leverage lifecycle hooks for managing resources and logging
- Ensure proper error handling and logging in tools
- Use `stdio` transport for local development and `sse` for cloud deployment
- Implement caching mechanisms using lifecycle context for performance optimization
- 優化完成後，請一併修改或更新專案內相關檔案(包括相依的程式檔、readme.md 等)。
